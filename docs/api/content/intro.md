## Cumulus API

The Cumulus API allows developers to interact with the Cumulus workflow engine, such as monitoring status or creating, editing, and deleting records. This is the same API that powers the Cumulus dashboard.

By utilizing this API, a developer can integrate with the Cumulus engine in whatever language or environment is most comfortable or useful; although interacting with Cumulus through the Cumulus dashboard may be appropriate for many end users, for some use cases it's best to have the flexibility of a web-accessible API.

The API accepts and responds with JSON payloads at various HTTPS endpoints.

In order to use these endpoints, you must include authentication information in your HTTPS request; authentication is explained in the following section.

The following table lists the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) parameters that can be used with most of the Cumulus API endpoints. `{fieldName}` is a stand-in for any of the fields in the record, and for nested objects dot notation can be used; for example, valid `fieldName`s include: `pdrName`, `status`, and `recipe.processStep.description`.

| query string parameter | description |
| -----  | ----------- |
| `limit={number}` | number of records to be returned by the API call; default is `1`, maximum is `100` |
| `page={number}` | page number, 1-indexed; default is `1` |
| `sort_by={fieldName}` | which field to sort by; default is `timestamp` |
| `order={asc|desc}` | whether to sort in `asc` or `desc` order |
| `prefix={value}` | `startsWith` search of the `granuleId`, `status`, `pdrName`, `collectionName`, and `userName` fields |
| `fields={fieldName1, fieldName2}` | which fields to return, separated by a comma |
| `{fieldName}={value}` | exact value match for the given field |
| `{fieldName}__from={number}`  | for numeric fields, field value must be greater than the given number |
| `{fieldName}__to={number}`  | for numeric fields, field value must be less than the given number |
| `{fieldName}__not={value}` | field does not match the given value |
| `{fieldName}__in={value1, value2}` | field matches _one of_ the values in the comma-separated list |
| `{fieldName}__exists={true|false}` | field exists or doesn't exist in the record |
| `q="fieldName:(1 TO 2) AND fieldName2: (3 To 4)"` | arbitrary Apache Lucene query syntax, _not needed for most uses of the API_; if the `q` parameter is used, all other query parameters will be ignored, besides `limit`, `page`, and `fields` |
